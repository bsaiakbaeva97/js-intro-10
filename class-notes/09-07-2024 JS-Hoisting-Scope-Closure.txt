Hoisting: using functions and variables before they're declared

-Function declarations will be hoisted 
-Arrow functions and function expression are not hoisted, you cannot use this before their initialization

-var keyword is hoisted 
-let and const are not hoisted
-var-let-const respect the global and function scope 
-let and const also respect the block scope while var does not support block scope 



for() {
  let number = 10; 
  
  for() {
    let name = 'John';
  }

  console.log(name);
}
